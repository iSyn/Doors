This idea came to me a long time ago and I actually made the game in another language called GML
I had a lot of help from others when I first created the game so I wanted to recreate it, but from my code and only my code.

### Features I wanted to implement
More levels, but my code was so poorly written that it'll take hours just to write a simple level.
A working high score list would be nice in the secret level.
Fixing spawning outside of spawn area in secret level.
